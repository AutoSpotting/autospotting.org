After a lot of time of using the GitHub README.md as only web presence of the
project, AutoSpotting now has a dedicated homepage at
[autospotting.org](https://autospotting.org).

Previous blog posts about the project are still available on the author's
personal [blog](https://blog.cloudprowess.com).
